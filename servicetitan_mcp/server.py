  ST_TENANT_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET  — Client Secret for <NAME>
  ST_TENANT_<NAME>_APP_KEY        — App Key from the developer portal

    instructions="""ServiceTitan field-service API: customers, jobs, invoices, estimates, dispatch, pricebook, payroll, memberships, reporting.

HOW TO USE THIS SERVER EFFICIENTLY:

1. PREFER FILTERS OVER LISTING-THEN-SCANNING. Most `list_*` tools accept
   server-side filters (name, status, customer_id, date ranges). Use them.
   Listing every customer then filtering locally wastes API quota and tokens.

2. PAGINATION. `list_*` tools default to page_size=50. `page_size` is passed
   directly to ServiceTitan; most endpoints accept hundreds to a few thousand
   per page (ST enforces its own per-endpoint cap). Prefer a large `page_size`
   over many paged calls. ALWAYS trust the `hasMore=…` footer — NOT the number
   of items shown — to decide whether more pages exist. `totalCount` may be
   reported as `unknown` for endpoints that don't return it; in that case
   `hasMore` is inferred from whether a full page came back, so keep paging
   until `hasMore=False`.

3. RATE LIMITS ARE HANDLED FOR YOU. The client retries 429s with backoff, so
   transient throttling is invisible. But you can still exhaust quotas:
     - Main API: ~30 req/sec (soft cap, ST allows 60/sec)
     - Reporting API: ~3 req/min (ST hard cap is 5/min) — run_report is SLOW
   If you see a surfaced 429, reduce parallel tool calls or batch via filters.

4. REPORTING IS A LAST RESORT. Prefer domain-specific tools (list_invoices,
   list_jobs, list_payments) with date filters over `run_report`. Reports are
   slow, quota-constrained, and return schemas that vary by report_id. Only
   reach for `run_report` when no typed tool can answer the question (e.g.
   aggregated revenue breakdowns).

5. FIND-BEFORE-GET. `get_customer(customer_id)` needs an ID you don't know
   upfront. Use `list_customers(name=...)` to find the ID, then `get_customer`
   only if you need the full record.

6. ESCAPE HATCH. `servicetitan_api_call` exposes arbitrary endpoints (use
   `{tenant_id}` placeholder). Use when a typed tool doesn't cover the
   endpoint you need — e.g. unusual search params, POST/PATCH writes, or
   beta endpoints. Check ServiceTitan's API docs for the exact path.
