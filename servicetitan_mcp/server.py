    instructions="""ServiceTitan field-service API: customers, jobs, invoices, estimates, dispatch, pricebook, payroll, memberships, reporting.

HOW TO USE THIS SERVER EFFICIENTLY:

1. PREFER FILTERS OVER LISTING-THEN-SCANNING. Most `list_*` tools accept
   server-side filters (name, status, customer_id, date ranges). Use them.
   Listing every customer then filtering locally wastes API quota and tokens.

2. PAGINATION. `list_*` tools default to page_size=200 (run_report stays at
   50 — its quota is much tighter). `page_size` is passed directly to
   ServiceTitan; most endpoints accept hundreds to a few thousand per page
   (ST enforces its own per-endpoint cap). For full-table scans, raise
   page_size further (500–1000) rather than walking many pages. ALWAYS trust
   the `hasMore=…` footer — NOT the number of items shown — to decide
   whether more pages exist. `totalCount` may be reported as `unknown` for
   endpoints that don't return it; in that case `hasMore` is inferred from
   whether a full page came back, so keep paging until `hasMore=False`.

3. RATE LIMITS ARE HANDLED FOR YOU. The client retries 429s with backoff, so
   transient throttling is invisible. But you can still exhaust quotas:
     - Main API: ~30 req/sec (soft cap, ST allows 60/sec)
     - Reporting API: ~3 req/min (ST hard cap is 5/min) — run_report is SLOW
   If you see a surfaced 429, reduce parallel tool calls or batch via filters.

4. REPORTING IS A LAST RESORT. Prefer domain-specific tools (list_invoices,
   list_jobs, list_payments) with date filters over `run_report`. Reports are
   slow, quota-constrained, and return schemas that vary by report_id. Only
   reach for `run_report` when no typed tool can answer the question (e.g.
   aggregated revenue breakdowns). To run a specific report end-to-end:
   `get_report(category, report_id)` for its parameter schema → for any param
   with an `acceptValues.dynamicSetId`, `get_report_parameter_values(setId)`
   to get the legal value → `run_report(...)`. (Discover ids first via
   `list_report_categories` → `list_reports_in_category(category)` if unknown.)
   Each is a reporting-bucket call, so resolve value sets once and reuse them.

5. FIND-BEFORE-GET. `get_customer(customer_id)` needs an ID you don't know
   upfront. Use `list_customers(name=...)` to find the ID, then `get_customer`
   only if you need the full record.

6. STATIC LOOKUPS ARE CACHEABLE WITHIN A SESSION. When you need IDs from
   several of these tables, call `get_lookup_tables` once — it bundles the
   fan-out into one tool call. Otherwise, individual tools whose docstring
   contains the phrase "static config" (`list_business_units`,
   `list_job_types`, `list_zones`, `list_warehouses`, `list_payment_types`,
   `list_tax_zones`, `list_payment_terms`, `list_membership_types`,
   `list_tag_types`, `list_activity_categories`, `list_pricebook_categories`,
   `list_inventory_vendors`, `list_trucks`, `list_user_roles`,
   `list_campaigns`) rarely change. Call once per conversation and reuse
   the IDs — re-fetching them on every question wastes calls. If your
   client supports MCP resources, prefer reading
   `servicetitan://lookups/{tenant}/{kind}` (or `servicetitan://tenants`
   for tenant discovery) over the corresponding `list_*` tool — same
   data, no tool-call charge, and the server caches each (tenant, kind)
   for an hour.

7. `list_*` USUALLY BEATS `get_*`. The list payload almost always contains
   every field `get_*` would return for the same record. Only call `get_*`
   when the docstring explicitly says you need extended fields not in the
   list response (line items on `get_invoice` / `get_estimate`, full custom
   fields and tags on `get_job`, full contact blocks on `get_customer`).

8. ESCAPE HATCH. `servicetitan_api_call` exposes arbitrary endpoints (use
   `{tenant_id}` placeholder). Use when a typed tool doesn't cover the
   endpoint you need — e.g. unusual search params, POST/PATCH writes, or
   beta endpoints. Check ServiceTitan's API docs for the exact path.
