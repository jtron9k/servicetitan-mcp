# ServiceTitan MCP Server

Connect Claude to ServiceTitan via API. 60 tools covering CRM, Jobs, Accounting, Estimates, Dispatch, Pricebook, Inventory, Memberships, Payroll, Marketing, Reporting, Timesheets, Telecom, and more.

Multi-tenant: one server instance can query any number of ServiceTitan tenants on a per-call basis, including cross-tenant aggregation.

## Credits

This project is a fork of [glassdoc/servicetitan-mcp](https://github.com/glassdoc/servicetitan-mcp), created by the [glassdoc](https://github.com/glassdoc) team. All credit for the original design and the bulk of the implementation goes to them. This fork adds fixes for production auth, improved error surfacing, a corrected `run_report` endpoint, and multi-tenant support.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/glassdoc/servicetitan-mcp.git
cd servicetitan-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "servicetitan": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "servicetitan_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "ST_TENANTS": "acme,other",

        "ST_TENANT_ACME_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "ST_TENANT_ACME_CLIENT_ID": "cid.your-client-id",
        "ST_TENANT_ACME_CLIENT_SECRET": "cs1.your-client-secret",
        "ST_TENANT_ACME_APP_KEY": "your-app-key",

        "ST_TENANT_OTHER_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "ST_TENANT_OTHER_CLIENT_ID": "cid.your-client-id",
        "ST_TENANT_OTHER_CLIENT_SECRET": "cs1.your-client-secret",
        "ST_TENANT_OTHER_APP_KEY": "your-app-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Env var schema

- `ST_TENANTS` — comma-separated list of tenant names. Names must be lowercase and match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`. These are the names the LLM uses in tool calls, so pick slugs that are recognizable when phrased naturally ("st_louis" rather than "t1").
- For each name in `ST_TENANTS`, set four namespaced vars where `<NAME>` is the uppercase form of the slug:
  - `ST_TENANT_<NAME>_ID` — numeric ServiceTitan tenant id (used in API URLs).
  - `ST_TENANT_<NAME>_CLIENT_ID` — OAuth2 Client ID.
  - `ST_TENANT_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` — OAuth2 Client Secret.
  - `ST_TENANT_<NAME>_APP_KEY` — `ST-App-Key` header value from the Developer Portal.

If one ServiceTitan app is authorized against multiple tenants, the `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET` / `APP_KEY` will be identical across tenants and only `ID` differs. If each tenant has its own app registration, all four vary. The schema supports both.

For a complete ready-to-edit example, see [`claude_desktop_config_example.json`](claude_desktop_config_example.json).

## Getting Your Credentials

For each tenant:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations > API Application Access** in that ServiceTitan tenant.
2. Find the **Claude MCP Integration** app and click **Connect**.
3. Fill in the restriction fields (booking_provider, gps_provider, report_category).
4. Accept Terms and Conditions.
5. Copy your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**.
6. Your **Tenant ID** is shown in the top-right corner of any ServiceTitan page.
7. Your **App Key** is provided by ServiceTitan when your integration app is registered — obtain it directly from your own ServiceTitan account/integration setup.

## Multi-Tenant Usage

### The `tenant` argument

Every tool takes a required `tenant: str` as its first argument naming one of the configured tenants. There is no default — calling any tool without `tenant` raises a schema error from FastMCP. This is intentional: a silent wrong-tenant answer ("most recent job" on the wrong business) is worse than any UX inconvenience.

### Discovery: `list_tenants`

A new no-arg tool, `list_tenants`, returns the configured tenant names. The LLM typically calls this first when the user names a business by name, so it can map phrasing → tenant slug correctly.

### Cross-tenant queries

The server itself is always single-tenant per call. Cross-tenant aggregation is LLM-orchestrated: when the user asks something like *"total jobs booked across all businesses last month"*, Claude fans out — one tool call per tenant — and aggregates the results in its reply. No server-side join, no cross-tenant auth, no shared rate-limiter contention.

Practically, this means:

- **Per-tenant rate limiting is independent.** The 30 rps main / 3 rpm reporting limits apply *per tenant*, so four tenants have 4× the headroom of a single tenant in burst scenarios.
- **OAuth tokens cache per tenant.** The `TokenManager` is keyed on `tenant_id`, so sequential cross-tenant use does not invalidate any one tenant's token.
- **Concurrent cross-tenant fan-out works.** The process-wide concurrency semaphore (`ST_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, default 10) caps total parallelism, not per-tenant.

Example flows:

- *"Most recent job in St. Louis"* → single `list_jobs(tenant="st_louis", ...)` call.
- *"Show me revenue by business last month"* → Claude calls `list_invoices(tenant="...", created_on_or_after=...)` once per configured tenant and sums.

### Unknown tenant errors

Calling a tool with a tenant slug that isn't configured returns a structured error listing the valid names:

```
Unknown tenant 'foo'. Configured: acme, other. Call list_tenants for the authoritative list.
```

## Migrating from single-tenant

If you're upgrading from a pre-multi-tenant version of this server, your previous env vars (`ST_APP_KEY`, `ST_CLIENT_ID`, `ST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ST_TENANT_ID`) are no longer read. On startup with the old config you'll see:

```
RuntimeError: ST_TENANTS is not set, but legacy single-tenant vars are
present: ST_TENANT_ID, ST_APP_KEY, ST_CLIENT_ID, ST_CLIENT_SECRET. This
server is now multi-tenant. Set ST_TENANTS=<comma-separated names> and
namespaced vars ST_TENANT_<NAME>_ID / _CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET /
_APP_KEY per tenant. See README for the full migration.
```

Migration takes ~5 minutes per tenant: rename the four old vars with an `ST_TENANT_<NAME>_` prefix, and add `ST_TENANTS=<name>` naming that tenant. To add additional tenants, repeat the four-var block with new names and extend `ST_TENANTS`.

## Authentication

Uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. Tokens auto-refresh every 15 minutes. Tokens cache per `tenant_id`, so cross-tenant use does not invalidate each other. No user interaction required.

## Common Workflows

Recipes for frequent questions, with the tool sequence Claude should pick. Every tool takes `tenant` as the first argument — omitted below for brevity, but always required.

### Find a customer by name (then drill down)
1. `list_customers(tenant=..., name="Smith")` → returns candidates with IDs, contact blocks, primary location.
2. Optional `get_customer(tenant=..., customer_id=...)` only if you need custom fields not in the list response.

### Find a customer by phone or email
The `list_customers` endpoint has no phone/email filter. Two options:
- `servicetitan_api_call(tenant=..., method="GET", path="/crm/v2/tenant/{tenant_id}/customers", query_params='{"phone":"555-0100"}')` — works if ST exposes `phone` on this tenant.
- Fallback: `list_contacts` with date range and match locally.

### Full job timeline for a customer
1. `list_customers(tenant=..., name=...)` → customerId
2. `list_jobs(tenant=..., customer_id=...)` → jobIds (status, dates)
3. For a specific job: `list_appointments(tenant=..., starts_on_or_after=...)` filtered to that job, or `get_job(tenant=..., job_id=...)` for full detail
4. `list_invoices(tenant=..., job_id=...)` for billing side
5. `list_estimates(tenant=..., job_id=...)` if a quote exists

### Revenue for a date range
- Simple total: `list_invoices(tenant=..., created_on_or_after="2024-01-01")` — sum client-side.
- Broken down by Business Unit or campaign: use `run_report` (reporting quota applies, slower). Step through `list_report_categories` → `list_reports_in_category` to find the right report and its parameter schema first.

### Cross-tenant aggregation
- *"Revenue across all businesses last month"* → call `list_invoices` once per tenant from `list_tenants`, sum client-side.
- *"Which business has the most open estimates right now?"* → call `list_estimates(status="Open")` once per tenant, compare counts.

Claude orchestrates the fan-out; there's no server-side aggregation tool and no need to call `list_tenants` in the query path if the tenant set is already known.

### Technician's schedule today
1. `list_appointment_assignments(tenant=..., starts_on_or_after="2024-04-22", starts_on_or_before="2024-04-23")`
2. Cross-reference with `list_technicians(tenant=...)` (cache this — small and static) to map IDs → names.

### Open estimates by business unit
1. `list_business_units(tenant=...)` — cache the BU ID → name map.
2. `list_estimates(tenant=..., status="Open")` — note `businessUnitId` per estimate, group client-side.

### Membership renewals due this month
1. `list_memberships(tenant=..., status="Active")` — look at `nextScheduledDate` / `to` expiry.
2. For the tune-up visits themselves: `list_recurring_services(tenant=...)`.

### Marketing channel ROI
1. `list_campaigns(tenant=...)` — cache campaign ID → name.
2. `list_campaign_costs(tenant=..., campaign_id=...)` for spend.
3. `list_invoices(tenant=..., created_on_or_after=...)` then group by each job's campaignId for revenue attribution.

## Rate limits and error handling

ServiceTitan enforces **per app per tenant**:
- **Main API:** 60 requests/second.
- **Reporting API:** 5 requests/minute per report.

This server layers the following in front of those limits:

- **Per-tenant token buckets.** Each tenant gets its own pair (main + reporting) — they don't share quota. Four tenants have 4× the aggregate burst headroom of a single tenant. Defaults: `30 rps` main, `3 rpm` reporting (half the hard caps, leaving room for bursts). Override via:
  - `ST_RATE_LIMIT_RPS` (default `30`)
  - `ST_REPORTING_RPM` (default `3`)
  - `ST_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default `10`) — process-wide cap on in-flight requests across all tenants
- **Automatic retry** on `429`, `502`, `503`, `504`:
  - Honors `Retry-After` header if the server sends one.
  - Otherwise exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s, max 3 retries.
  - On final failure, the HTTP error (including response body) is raised so Claude sees what went wrong.
- **Shared connection pool**: one `httpx.AsyncClient` is reused across all tool calls and all tenants to avoid per-request TCP handshakes. Pooling is per-host; ST is one host, so splitting per tenant would gain nothing.

Retries log to stderr at the `[servicetitan-mcp]` prefix — tail the Claude Desktop logs to observe backoff behavior when investigating slowness.
